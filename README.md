## Artefact
F/EAR THIS! is a double album published by PEACE in 1987, the association of independent Italian alternative labels in support of "A / Anarchist Magazine ".

### Music & Ideas, curated by Marco Pandin 
"F / Ear this!" is a double album published by PEACE, the association of independent Italian alternative labels (which includes Blu Bus, Catfood Press, Particolare Music, Rockgarage, Trax, Ut / Comunicazioni and, recently, also Tunnel) in support of "A / Anarchist Magazine ".

The project was born at the beginning of last year: putting together music, words and images built around a common idea, asking for help from friends, musicians, graphic designers and poets scattered everywhere, both in Italy and abroad. All in all a simple and transparent initiative: once the theme was chosen (in this case, "fear"), a word-of-mouth mechanism was set in motion which, despite some complications and the inevitable accidents and delays, worked very well, arriving from here around Europe to the United States. Made some phone calls, sent a few letters and so put the rumor around, the material for "F / Ear this!" it came almost by itself: no contracts, no fees for participation, nor promises difficult to keep. Everyone collaborated freely and spontaneously, an absolutely indispensable condition for being able to "work" cleanly and satisfactorily.

In terms of musical "genres", this collection is obviously quite composite: it ranges from large and evocative atmospheres (the compositions of Giorgio Cantoni and the 2 + 2 = 5, for example) to the minimal chiseling work (the French Look De Bouk and the New Yorkers Hum), from hot and intelligent rock (Franti and the German Body & the Buildings among others) to the more cerebral experimentalism (such as that of Nurse With Wound and ParoksiEksta) to chemical laboratory jazz (Doctor Nerve, Don King and our Detonation).
We remain however, and this applies to all participants, in an "attitude sector" that sees creativity as a vital and positive fact, an instrument that, through words, sounds and images, tells people, their ideas, dreams and desires .

### Booklet
It’s difficult to tell something about « fear ». Also because every time it is different. The fear to be not able of speaking, the fear to be not able of acting, to be alone, to know not enough; to have no ways out but only fixed courses and the fear to be not able of breathing the real air, to be far away from the changes of your own people; the fear to be always out of place and to be forced to stay in places where you wouldn’t like to stay. But always with a common denominator: it’s immediately fear. Imposed by the external conditions, swallowed every day with the same constancy of the passing minutes. In the close of a jail or inside the stomach of a mine, in your bed at night or, sometimes, on the stage; a morning when you can’t get up to go working or one night watching the river. But nothing can really get in our eyes remaining just a word, a sign unfleshed by the abuse of its meaning: is the depth of the « simple » living that takes away the dust, that changes the colors, that presents a breath and so the fear can be touched, sniffed, waited, circumscribed, faced somehow. VOGHERA (a naked tune: the time/tempo of the drum - the passing time and the subjective time; a voice; a far and extraneous sound of a saxophone) is a jail for women: here some of them had decided some time ago to choose maternity: aseptic words that mean very precise lives, years, places, feelings. Voghera seems an empty circle. If the mass media tell something about it, it is just for saying: »Look ou! Think about what you’re doing if you don’t want to end up in this place » or « do a quiet life and so Voguera will not exist ». Precisely an empty circle, that everyone can fill up like he wants: with words, images, convictions, ideological propositions, but it’s a circle. The Indians of America divided the world and the life in circles: their houses had a circular shape too. The beginning and the ending unite. Where: a point at random but everything unites. And, where it just seems to be a point of ending, of death, here thirst of life comes up, the push to transmit it, the proposal to the world of a new life, the struggle for a better world, the beginning of other circles. ACQUA DI LUNA (« moon water ») is what, according to a popular saying from Borneo, springs at last at the light of the moon after being hidden for a long time...

## Research 
### Research Questions 
You can't see fear, can't hold it in your hands. It's experience based, what are the tools that can be used to recreate this context digitally?

Is fear something universal, or does it change depending on the localisation, the epoch? Is there a need to archive different form of fear, from different epochs, from different countries?

If it is necessary to keep an updated archive of fear samples, what would be this samples of contemporary fear be looking like?

## Transcoding
With the technological resilience, how to preserve audio in the best quality and easiest accessibilty? The original rpm record is one of the most stable audio formats, capable of lasting around 100 years in a controlled environnement. But one copy, stuck in the archive, isn't accessible to a lot of people. The project should reach everyone, as everyone already experienced fear at least once in their life. How to preserve the meaning of the audio, but making it accessible to a broader audience? A website was the ideal thing. The website is generating sound by the users movement, creating a new digital fear inspired experience, blurring the distinction between consumer and producer, audience and author.On the other hand, samples from the original tracklist is made accessible by using the keyboard.

## Transcoding No. 1
### Cover and Logo redesign
On the IISG website, no image of the record is available. The first technical transcoding was doing reproduction of the original record, but since it's no longer accessible. A digital remake had to be done. Now it's also printable, if one time someone would like to have a physical copy. The logo also had to be vectorized, so future transcoding don't destroy the old images.

## Transcoding Tool 
### Description
Creating sound digitally, playing with the interactive possibilities of the computer to generate, randomly, or artificially sounds that refer to the language of fear, or personnal emotions. The whole website is the transcoding tool, using a platform as an environnement instead of a transparent piedestral showing objects or a finished work. It is also questionning the process of works, having a musical experience that is for everyone unique.
How can sound be created artificially? Music has always evolved with human errors, interpretations. Creating sound by coding seems to be achieving the dream of perfection, or is it maybe a nightmare?

### Aims
The aim of the tool is to create a new digital experience for the user, based on his own movements.  

### Methods
p5.js was mainly used for creating the sound. Quicktime player and basic sound tools were also used. For the visual language, C4D was mainly used.

## Reflection
Fear is now omnipresent in our way of living. We are always hiding it, trying to escape from it. With this project, it's also about experiencing this feeling in a new way, talking about digital sensations that are more and more present.

## Outcomes
An interactive sound website
