# Music & ideas (en)
curated by Marco Pandin ([marcpan@tin.it](mailto:marcpan@tin.it))
"F / Ear this!" is a double album published by PEACE, the association of independent Italian alternative labels (which includes Blu Bus, Catfood Press, Particolare Music, Rockgarage, Trax, Ut / Comunicazioni and, recently, also Tunnel) in support of "A / Anarchist Magazine ".

The project was born at the beginning of last year: putting together music, words and images built around a common idea, asking for help from friends, musicians, graphic designers and poets scattered everywhere, both in Italy and abroad. All in all a simple and transparent initiative: once the theme was chosen (in this case, "fear"), a word-of-mouth mechanism was set in motion which, despite some complications and the inevitable accidents and delays, worked very well, arriving from here around Europe to the United States. Made some phone calls, sent a few letters and so put the rumor around, the material for "F / Ear this!" it came almost by itself: no contracts, no fees for participation, nor promises difficult to keep. Everyone collaborated freely and spontaneously, an absolutely indispensable condition for being able to "work" cleanly and satisfactorily.

In terms of musical "genres", this collection is obviously quite composite: it ranges from large and evocative atmospheres (the compositions of Giorgio Cantoni and the 2 + 2 = 5, for example) to the minimal chiseling work (the French Look De Bouk and the New Yorkers Hum), from hot and intelligent rock (Franti and the German Body & the Buildings among others) to the more cerebral experimentalism (such as that of Nurse With Wound and ParoksiEksta) to chemical laboratory jazz (Doctor Nerve, Don King and our Detonation).
We remain however, and this applies to all participants, in an "attitude sector" that sees creativity as a vital and positive fact, an instrument that, through words, sounds and images, tells people, their ideas, dreams and desires .
