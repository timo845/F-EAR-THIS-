# Music & ideas (en)
curated by Marco Pandin ([marcpan@tin.it](mailto:marcpan@tin.it))
"F / Ear this!" is a double album published by PEACE, the association of independent Italian alternative labels (which includes Blu Bus, Catfood Press, Particolare Music, Rockgarage, Trax, Ut / Comunicazioni and, recently, also Tunnel) in support of "A / Anarchist Magazine ".

The project was born at the beginning of last year: putting together music, words and images built around a common idea, asking for help from friends, musicians, graphic designers and poets scattered everywhere, both in Italy and abroad. All in all a simple and transparent initiative: once the theme was chosen (in this case, "fear"), a word-of-mouth mechanism was set in motion which, despite some complications and the inevitable accidents and delays, worked very well, arriving from here around Europe to the United States. Made some phone calls, sent a few letters and so put the rumor around, the material for "F / Ear this!" it came almost by itself: no contracts, no fees for participation, nor promises difficult to keep. Everyone collaborated freely and spontaneously, an absolutely indispensable condition for being able to "work" cleanly and satisfactorily.

In terms of musical "genres", this collection is obviously quite composite: it ranges from large and evocative atmospheres (the compositions of Giorgio Cantoni and the 2 + 2 = 5, for example) to the minimal chiseling work (the French Look De Bouk and the New Yorkers Hum), from hot and intelligent rock (Franti and the German Body & the Buildings among others) to the more cerebral experimentalism (such as that of Nurse With Wound and ParoksiEksta) to chemical laboratory jazz (Doctor Nerve, Don King and our Detonation).
We remain however, and this applies to all participants, in an "attitude sector" that sees creativity as a vital and positive fact, an instrument that, through words, sounds and images, tells people, their ideas, dreams and desires .


# Booklet Text(en)

It’s difficult to tell something about « fear ». Also because every time it is different. The fear to be not able of speaking, the fear to be not able of acting, to be alone, to know not enough; to have no ways out but only fixed courses and the fear to be not able of breathing the real air, to be far away from the changes of your own people; the fear to be always out of place and to be forced to stay in places where you wouldn’t like to stay. But always with a common denominator: it’s immediately fear. Imposed by the external conditions, swallowed every day with the same constancy of the passing minutes. In the close of a jail or inside the stomach of a mine, in your bed at night or, sometimes, on the stage; a morning when you can’t get up to go working or one night watching the river. But nothing can really get in our eyes remaining just a word, a sign unfleshed by the abuse of its meaning: is the depth of the « simple » living that takes away the dust, that changes the colors, that presents a breath and so the fear can be touched, sniffed, waited, circumscribed, faced somehow. VOGHERA (a naked tune: the time/tempo of the drum - the passing time and the subjective time; a voice; a far and extraneous sound of a saxophone) is a jail for women: here some of them had decided some time ago to choose maternity: aseptic words that mean very precise lives, years, places, feelings. Voghera seems an empty circle. If the mass media tell something about it, it is just for saying: »Look ou! Think about what you’re doing if you don’t want to end up in this place » or « do a quiet life and so Voguera will not exist ». Precisely an empty circle, that everyone can fill up like he wants: with words, images, convictions, ideological propositions, but it’s a circle. The Indians of America divided the world and the life in circles: their houses had a circular shape too. The beginning and the ending unite. Where: a point at random but everything unites. And, where it just seems to be a point of ending, of death, here thirst of life comes up, the push to transmit it, the proposal to the world of a new life, the struggle for a better world, the beginning of other circles. ACQUA DI LUNA (« moon water ») is what, according to a popular saying from Borneo, springs at last at the light of the moon after being hidden for a long time.

« …he is born on the third of November, first day of snow of the year. »
« …the hours of the evening, of the night, like the other things…waiting…to live a present where eternally something fails, the most important things, to wait for a future that is a tangle, ‘couse, we already know, it will be the same of this present which we don’t give up to live. The hours of the new day with the same times ».
« …the clock says the hours. But which hours?…On, back…on, back… You miss the voices, you miss them to say the time, to fill up this place…monstrous silence ».
« …There is almost the fear to tell us everything, we speak about what we are living, but something fails…It’s hard to tell the limits, easy to understand these walls too heavy, hard to insert the overload of the mind. »
« I try to sleep, but the sleep doesn’t come; who knows if the others are still here. »
« …I break the time, I break this clock useless by now, this time said by someone else, of days, of hours, minutes. »
« …The want of music…scentes and colors… without anything to remember. »

Voghera.

Two stones fall on the iron and invisible door
Two hours born by chance dead every day
Glasses that make a labored breathing
The round wardrobe touches the sky/ceiling
The day and the night opened by the walls and the skin
With their noises
The love and the thin hairs of the children
Red iron in your nails
And break the pencil, stubborn
She understands the time,
You’re outside and inside it
And the voice gets tired faster then
You don’t know when
You don’t know when
Yesterday also you were here outside
Today you are all and you
Two hours born by chance dead all days
Run now, run now, run now,
The bed doesn’t speak
Leave it, let it dream
Run now.
